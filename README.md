# üí∏ CryptoClipper

CryptoClipper is a super-efficient and probably best open-source stealthy cryptocurrency address manipulation tool designed to replace clipboard addresses with your own. Don't forget to only use this program for educational purposes.

## ‚≠ê Features

- **Persistence** - Once it's on a system, CryptoClipper stays there. Even system restarts won't remove this little guy.
- **Mutex** - CryptoClipper uses mutex mechanisms to prevent multiple instances of itself from running on the same system.
- **0 CPU usage** - This tool is incredibly lightweight and won't bog down the system it's running on.
- **Small** - This program only takes like 2,3 mb of disk space, it only uses 2 crates
- **Force UAC** - It will force user to give this program administrator permissions
- **Stealthy** - It's not easy to find the virus on the victim's computer
- **6 Cryptocurrencies** - Our clipper supports BTC, XMR, DGE, LTC, ETH and Bitcoin cash
- **Windows defender bypass** - Clipper will add itself to windows defender exclusions once it executes
- **TODO: XOR** - Encrypt all strings at compile time and decompile at runtime to avoid detection 
- **TODO: Virustotal bypass** - Ignore all Virustotal bots & Detect VM usage

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing

1. Open main.rs file and replace the addresses with your own
2. Compile the program using `cargo build`
